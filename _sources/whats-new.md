---

## AVBlocks 2.1

### Samples

* New `capture_ds_video_audio` sample that shows how to build a video recorder with AVBlocks and DirectShow. DirectShow is used for video capture and AVBlocks is used for audio/video encoding. Instead of using a single transcoder, separate transcoders are used for encoding and muxing. Encoded audio is saved to a separate file.
* New `dec_avc_au` sample that shows how to decode a AVC/H.264 stream. The sample uses a sequence of files to simulate a stream of AVC/H.264 Access Units and a Transcoder object to decode the AVC/H.264 Access Units to raw YUV video frames.  
* New `dec_avc_push` sample that shows how to use the Transcoder.Push method to decode AVC/H.264 Access Units (AU) to a YUV uncompressed video file.
* New `dec_avc_pull` sample that shows how to use the Transcoder.Pull method to decode an AVC/H.264 file to YUV uncompressed video file.
* New `demux_mp4_file` sample that shows how to extract the first audio and video elementary stream from an MP4 container and save each of the streams to a separate MP4 file. 
* New `dump_avc_au` sample that shows how to split an AVC/H.264 elementary stream to Access Units (AU). The sample accepts an input AVC/H.264 file and an output folder. The sample reads the input file and writes the H.264 access units to the output folder, each AU is written in a separate file. The sample also displays the NAL units within each access unit. 
* New `enc_mpg_dvd` sample that shows how to convert any supported video input to an MPEG-2 PS suitable for DVD-Video authoring.

---

## AVBlocks 2.0

### API

* The MediaInfo object now implements the Block abstract interface.  

### Samples

* New `overlay_mp4_png_file` sample. This sample shows how to place a watermark on a video file by blending a video file with a PNG image.

---

## AVBlocks 1.26

### API

* New Block abstract interface to serve as a base for future AVBlocks media components.
* The Transcoder object now implements the Block abstract interface. The next step will be to redo the MediaInfo object and implement it as a block / component.  

### Hardware Acceleration

* The CaptureDS sample uses AVC / H.264 hardware acceleration on modern hardware, e.g. Intel HD Graphics / QuickSync GPUs, NVIDIA Kepler GPUs and Maxwell GPUs, and AMD GCN 1, 2, 3 GPUs. 

### Samples
* New `dec_avc_file` sample. This sample shows how to use the Transcoder.Run method to decode an AVC / H.264 file to a YUV file.
* New `dump_avc_au` sample. This sample reads an AVC / H.264 elementary stream from a file and writes extracted AVC / H.264 AUs (Access Units) to a folder, each AU is written in a separate file, one AU per file.
* New `enc_avc_file` sample. This sample shows how to use the Transcoder.Run method to encode a raw YUV video file to a compressed AVC / H.264 video file. 
* New `enc_avc_push` sample. This sample shows how to use the Transcoder.Push method to encode a raw YUV video stream to compressed AVC / H.264 video file.
* New `overlay_yuv_jpegs_push_pull` sample. This sample takes as input a source yuv video and a directory of JPEG images, and produces a YUV video where each JPEG image is overlaid on top of the source video for "image count / duration" seconds.
* C++ sample projects on Windows have been upgraded to Visual Studio 2015

### Docs

* On Windows, the .NET assembly XML documentation is now available together with the binaries. If you use Visual Studio, you should be able to see the AVBlocks documentation right in your code.
* On Mac, we now distribute an Apple doc set, so the AVBlocks documentation can be viewed right within Xcode.  

### Installers

* The Windows binaries are now packaged in a simple zip archive - no more self-extracting RAR executables. 

### Samples

#### ReEncode

* The new ReEncode sample for C++ and C# (.NET). The ReEncode sample takes an MP4 input and re-encodes the audio and video streams back into MP4 output again. 

### Transcoder

#### Codecs

##### AVC / H.264

* The AVC / H.264 encoder has been optimized and now uses all CPU cores to the fullest. The new parallel implementation is based on the [Windows Concurrency Runtime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee207192.aspx) on Windows, the [Grand Central Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref) on Mac OS, and the [Intel Threading Building Blocks](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) on Linux.

#### Containers

---

## AVBlocks 1.10

### C++ 

* New macros and methods are now available to get the AVBlocks version at compile time and run time.

### MediaInfo

* Stream detection has been improved and is now more robust
    
### MediaSocket

* The MediaSocket factory functions have been moved to the Library namespace (C++ only)

### Samples 

* New CaptureDS sample demonstrates how to record video and audio from video camera to file. The code uses DirectShow for audio/video capture and AVBlocks for audio/video encoding. The CaptureDS sample is available both in C++ and in .NET (C#).
* The .NET ImageSequence sample is now available in VB.NET and C#.  

### Transcoder

#### Codecs

##### AVC / H.264

* AVC / H.264 encoder parameters are now better documented.
* New `AccessUnitDelimiters` parameter instructs the AVC / H.264 encoder to insert Access Unit Delimiters before each NALU  (Network Abstraction Layer Unit). Access Unit Delimiters are required by Apple Live HTTP Streaming tools like Apple's Media Stream Segmenter tool. For more information see the [AccessUnitDelimiters](http://doc.avblocks.com/cpp/1.10/namespaceprimo_1_1avblocks_1_1_param_1_1_encoder_1_1_video_1_1_h264.html#a54343bff676c170f67c2ad19ed0923b6) API documentation.

#### Containers

##### MP4 (MPEG-4)

* Transcoder will write the aspect ratio in a MP4 container when a AVC / H.264stream has non-square pixels.  

#### Presets

* Presets have been redefined as nested namespaces / classes and are much cleaner now. Going forward this will allow adding a great number of presets with less API clutter.
 
---

## AVBlocks 1.9

### Transcoder

#### Codecs

##### AAC

* Passthrough mode for AAC streams. AAC audio streams will be passed as is without re-encoding, when the audio output is the same as the input. This is especially useful for processing video part of a movie to different size or frame rate without touching the audio part.

#### Containers

##### MP4 (MPEG-4)

* MPEG-2 Video can now be used in a MP4 container (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003)

#### Filters

##### Video Frame Rate Converter (VFRC)

* The video frame rate converter has been improved to reduce jitter. The jitter is now kept under +125 ms / -45 ms.

#### Parameters

##### ConcealDefects

The new `ConcealDefects` parameter instructs the decoders to conceal bitstream defects and errors. The `ConcealDefects` parameter is currently supported by the AVC / H.264 decoder and the MPEG-4 Visual decoder. For more information see the [ConcealDefects](http://doc.avblocks.com/cpp/1.9/namespaceprimo_1_1avblocks_1_1_param_1_1_decoder_1_1_video.html#a10c4d86e9335b1e293dc3b29bb688fa4) API documentation.
 
---

## AVBlocks 1.8

### Transcoder

#### Parameters

##### MaxDecFrameBuffering

The new `MaxDecFrameBuffering` parameter allows one to override the `max_dec_frame_buffering` field in the Video Usability Information (VUI) of a AVC / H.264 stream. For more information see the [MaxDecFrameBuffering](http://doc.avblocks.com/cpp/1.8/namespaceprimo_1_1avblocks_1_1_param_1_1_decoder_1_1_video_1_1_h264_1_1_v_u_i.html#details) API documentation.

---

## AVBlocks 1.7

### C++

#### Breaking Changes

* The `InterlaceType` enumeration has been renamed to ScanType*. 
* The `VideoStreamInfo::scanType` property default is `ScanType::Unknown` instead of `ScanType::Progressive`. If you rely on the previous behavior now you have to set `VideoStreamInfo::scanType` to `Progressive` explicitly. 

### Platforms

#### Debian (Squeeze and Wheezy)

The AVBlocks SDK is now available for Debian. Both Squeeze and Wheezy are fully supported and will be supported in future releases.

#### Microsoft DirectShow

Due to popular demand, we have started AVBlocks for DirectShow. We are starting with these filters for now: 

* MPEG-2 Video Encoder 
* MPEG Audio Encoder 
* MPEG Muxer

However, the plan going forward is, to expose most of the AVBlocks functionality through DirectShow components. If you need a particular DirectShow codec or effect, please drop us a word in the [AVBlocks Support Group]( http://groups.google.com/group/avblocks-support). 

### Transcoder
