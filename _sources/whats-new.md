---

## AVBlocks 2.1

### Samples

* New `capture_ds_video_audio` sample that shows how to build a video recorder with AVBlocks and DirectShow. DirectShow is used for video capture and AVBlocks is used for audio/video encoding. Instead of using a single transcoder, separate transcoders are used for encoding and muxing. Encoded audio is saved to a separate file.
* New `dec_avc_au` sample that shows how to decode a AVC/H.264 stream. The sample uses a sequence of files to simulate a stream of AVC/H.264 Access Units and a Transcoder object to decode the AVC/H.264 Access Units to raw YUV video frames.  
* New `dec_avc_push` sample that shows how to use the Transcoder.Push method to decode AVC/H.264 Access Units (AU) to a YUV uncompressed video file.
* New `dec_avc_pull` sample that shows how to use the Transcoder.Pull method to decode an AVC/H.264 file to YUV uncompressed video file.
* New `demux_mp4_file` sample that shows how to extract the first audio and video elementary stream from an MP4 container and save each of the streams to a separate MP4 file. 
* New `dump_avc_au` sample that shows how to split an AVC/H.264 elementary stream to Access Units (AU). The sample accepts an input AVC/H.264 file and an output folder. The sample reads the input file and writes the H.264 access units to the output folder, each AU is written in a separate file. The sample also displays the NAL units within each access unit. 
* New `enc_mpg_dvd` sample that shows how to convert any supported video input to an MPEG-2 PS suitable for DVD-Video authoring.

---

## AVBlocks 2.0

Access Unit Delimiters are required by Apple Live HTTP Streaming tools like Apple's Media Stream Segmenter tool. For more information see the [AccessUnitDelimiters](http://doc.avblocks.com/cpp/1.10/namespaceprimo_1_1avblocks_1_1_param_1_1_encoder_1_1_video_1_1_h264.html#a54343bff676c170f67c2ad19ed0923b6) API documentation.

#### Containers

##### MP4 (MPEG-4)

* Transcoder will write the aspect ratio in a MP4 container when a AVC / H.264stream has non-square pixels.  

#### Presets

* Presets have been redefined as nested namespaces / classes and are much cleaner now. Going forward this will allow adding a great number of presets with less API clutter.
 
---

## AVBlocks 1.9

### Transcoder

#### Codecs

##### AAC

* Passthrough mode for AAC streams. AAC audio streams will be passed as is without re-encoding, when the audio output is the same as the input. This is especially useful for processing video part of a movie to different size or frame rate without touching the audio part.

The new `MaxDecFrameBuffering` parameter allows one to override the `max_dec_frame_buffering` field in the Video Usability Information (VUI) of a AVC / H.264 stream. For more information see the [MaxDecFrameBuffering](http://doc.avblocks.com/cpp/1.8/namespaceprimo_1_1avblocks_1_1_param_1_1_decoder_1_1_video_1_1_h264_1_1_v_u_i.html#details) API documentation.

---

## AVBlocks 1.7

### C++

#### Breaking Changes

* The `InterlaceType` enumeration has been renamed to ScanType*. 
* The `VideoStreamInfo::scanType` property default is `ScanType::Unknown` instead of `ScanType::Progressive`. If you rely on the previous behavior now you have to set `VideoStreamInfo::scanType` to `Progressive` explicitly. 

### Platforms

#### Debian (Squeeze and Wheezy)

The AVBlocks SDK is now available for Debian. Both Squeeze and Wheezy are fully supported and will be supported in future releases.

#### Microsoft DirectShow
